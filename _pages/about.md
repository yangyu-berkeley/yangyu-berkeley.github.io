I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar with Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore (BEARS), University of California.  I am now working with Prof. [Costas J. Spanos](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/spanos.html) (UC Berkeley) and Prof. [Guoqing Hu](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/gqhu/) (Nanyang Technological University) for the [Singapore-Berkeley Building Efficiency and Sustainability in the Tropics (SinBerBest)](https://sinberbest.berkeley.edu/), a National Research Foundation (NRF) of Singapore and headed by Prof. [Costas J. Spanos](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/spanos.html).

I obtained my PhD in the Department of Automation, [Tsinghua University]( https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm), Beijing, China in 2018 and was advised by Prof. [Xiaohong Guan](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/personalhg/xhguan/) and Prof. [(Samual) Qing-Shan Jia]( https://yangyu-bears-berkeley.github.io/bio.html).  
 
I got my BS in School of school of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, [Huazhong University of Science and Technology]( http://english.hust.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China in 2013 and was promoted to Tsinghua University as a doctoral candidate.
 

My research are mainly around developing algorithmic solutions for the control and optimization of large-scale dynamic networked system in virtue of reinforcement learning, stochastic optimization, decentralized optimization and  data-driven analysis techniques, with their applications to smart grids, smart buildings, and cyber-physical systems. 
I also have strong interest in game theory (noncooperative game, coalition game), transactive energy or transactive control and market design mechanisms with their application to build a flexible, adaptive, reliable and sustainable energy system. 

I am also interested in developing or enhancing theories by exploring the special structures of practical problems, with the attempt to study the extensions to other areas.
I am passionate with new theories or theories in different realms and their integration and interdisciplinary to provide better solution for the practical problems.
