I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). 

My research interests are in area of cyber-physical and energy systems, from the perspective of machine learning, optimization, and control.
During my Ph.D. studies, I developed algorithms for controlling and optimizing resources in energy systems and discovered fundamental, societal-scale insights in data-driven control systems. My work has been applied by Microsoft, Doosan Gridtech, Centrica, JD.com and DeepMind.
