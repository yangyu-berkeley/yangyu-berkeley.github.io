 My researches are mainly around developing <b> adaptive and scalable </b> algorithms for the control and optimization of large-scale dynamic networked systems arising from smart buildings, smart grids and cyber physical systems. 
My researches have stretched various theories and techniques, in particular,  
  ..* Decentralize convex or nonconvex optimization, decentralized decision-making </p></li>
   ..* Event-based optimization </p></li>
  ..* Stochastic optimization, Markov decision process, reinforcement learning 
 ..* Data-driven analysis and control. 


 I also have strong interest in <b>game theory (noncooperative game, coalition game), transactive energy or transactive control and market design mechanisms </b>with their application to build a flexible, adaptive, reliable and sustainable energy system.
 I am also interested in developing or enhancing theories from practical problems and exploring their extensions to other areas.
