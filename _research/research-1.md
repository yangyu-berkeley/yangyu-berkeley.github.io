Energy storage (ES) is one of the critical technologies to enable energy system transition, especially the integration of the renewable generation. Whereas the high capital cost defers its penetration into energy system. The justification of the ES capital cost relies on well-designed ES business models that can harness the maximum value for the stakeholders involved. 

The prosperity of sharing economy suggests its capability to bring capital-intensive ES resources to energy system through sharing. There are generally two sharing paradigms: *i*) multiple users cooperatively to invest and use a common-owned ES; *ii*) An energy storage operator (ESO) invests blocks of ES to gain profit by providing energy storage service to its consumers. However, the successful exertion relies on an appropriate market mechanism that can "allocate" the payoff among the different stakeholders involved, which is challenging due to multi-step operation pattern of the ES resource. We have made some contribution to facilitate the ES sharing models by using coalition game and non-cooperative game theory. 

* Optimal Sharing and Fair Cost Allocation of Community Energy Storage
In this project, we have studied the case where multiple users cooperatively invest a central ES, we formulate the communication of the users involved as a coalition game so as to maximize the total value co-created. Moreover, we develop a fair payoff allocation mechanism  represented by the nucleolus for the heterogeneous peer participants. The main innovation is that the proposed payoff allocation mechanism can reduce the exponential computation cost to linear thus able to be applied to large cooperation.

* Selling Renewable Integration Service to Consumers via a Cloud Energy Storage Model
For the second sharing paradigm that an energy storage operator (ESO) invests blocks of ES resource to gain profit by providing energy storage service to its consumers, we have designed a novel cloud energy storage model (CES). Similar to the cloud computing, a novel CES model by allowing the ESO to sell renewable integration service instead of renting ES capacity to its consumers. The proposed CES model adopts a socio-economic communication framework by allowing both the ESO and its consumers to maximize their monetary value. One innovation is that we designed a quadratic price model for the ESO to charge its consumers by the required renewable integration targets. Differing from most existing CES models sound viable but are not optimistic for application due to the low sharing efficiency, i.e., both the ESO and its consumers can not gain sufficient value from the ES sharing market, the proposed CES model admits an equilibrium and demonstrates near optimal social benefits (efficiency). Notably, this project can work as an example on how market design can shaping the efficiency of resource sharing in a competitive paradigm.
